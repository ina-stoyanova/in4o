# What my HBDI looks like. HBDI.. what?

My HBDI dominant profile is **yellow**, and it goes in this order - yellow > red > green > blue. Under stress it's ll about red & blue. 

_My understanding:_ 
- Depending on the situation and surroundings, one's perception and qualities that bubble up to the surface vary. Which is why one of my favourite things is observing body language, listening to the actions and not necessarily the words of people.

_How I like to roll_ 
- I like to **know the whole picture**. Give me the reasoning, how you got there, what's the context, what's the reason and I will become one with the task. And this is totally me being full-on yellow. Reason is - I need to see the things from your eyes, but will 100% apply my own perspective on top of that.
- I like to be given the **freedom of movement and mistakes** - this is how the best things come to live.
- I like a **challenge** and if it's in my comfort zone - I will go in head first. 
- **Patterns** make me feel comfortable and I find them extremely helpful when it's a new skill I'm learning. Hence, when you want me to understand something, I work well with examples and doing it myself.

_How I like to roll in a team_
- I like **experimenting with different techniques and team-oriented agile practices**. I'm all open to suggestions and feedback.
- I **love being a Scrum Master** - I get to do the above even more, getting a chance to work with people from a different angle. 
- I prefer **honest feedback, on the spot, in the situation**, rather than playing nice. It's not an easy thing to do, so before starting to work with someone, I will bring it up 100%.
- I work best when the **team is in sync**. I know, I know that's very subjective and not easy, but when it happens - you'll know it. 
- I don't like changing focus too many times, but have been in positions, where consulting on different teams requires it inevitably. 
- I take ownership and responsibility when no one else does. It's in my nature - I like to be in control of the situation, but I've learned that delegation is part of leading a team and being responsible. 

# Feedback
I think it's crucial to development. It's there for a reason and... 
- I prefer face-to-face chats as they're more flexible and each person's reactions can be observed. That combined with a follow up of written actions or a concise version of the feedback - worth everything.
- I give feedback when I feel I have something to say and share. 
- I think forced feedback is pointless.
- For me, I prefer feedback regarding a specific situation. Use examples, make it specific, tell me what you don't like about how we've worked together on the task, or how I could have reacted or acted in anotther way. I believe there's no right or wrong, just perceptions of it.
- All feedback is welcome, but I believe it should be with the right intention. 
- People can experiment with formats, but as long as it's clear to all parties - awesome. 
- Honest feedback is the driver of all things. You gotta be honest what works and when it doesn't even more important.

# Conflicts 
Conflicts are constructive, but again intention and attitude is everything. I would rather talk out the elephant in the room as soon as it's there and get it out of the way.
**The best way to win a war is not to be in a war.** 

# Favourite work environment 
- Interesting challenge, product that helps others or society
- Good music and chilled vibes
- Not too loud, not too many distractions
- Team collectiveness atmosphere - shared ideals and understanding helps, but diversity also does help
- Coffee/Tea breaks
- Random chat 
- Healthy competition 
- Friendly faces with jokes and banter
- Short, focused meetings
- Inclusiveness of the team, but not being pushy

# What doesn't work for me
- not having a clear understanding of what's the goal at hand when doing any sort of tasks
- non-stop pairing for the sake of pair programming 
- people not making a clear cut decision 
- too much noise
- bad lighting or music 
- lack of chocolate 
- plans of action that limit creativity and flexibility

# Natural leadership style
I've been told I've got a soft leadership style, but this is my view of me in that role:
- By default I fall into lecturing/teaching - I like talkig generic and in metaphors, but sometimes I realise it's not to the point. So raise it if it doesn't make sense in the situation for any reason.
- As the usual - I love to experiment 
- I like to get my hands dirty 
- I try to understand everything myself but know it's an impossible task
- I want guidance and feedback from people around me 
- I need problems to solve 
- I like to help people and that gives me best feeling of justice and for me it's part of being a good mentor and a leader

# My career goals
I've got 3. For good luck. 

- Specialise in DevOps, Systems administration, security and automation [DONE]
- Become a senior backend software engineer /a.k.a soltion architect/ [DONE] - comes inevitably with being a lead infrastructure engineer/devsecops lead (dependong on the project) - I end up needing to influence the architecture so that it meets good maturity and security standards.
- Teaching kids and getitng into mentoring/helping people - I'm more flexible and ad-hoc with this one [IN PROGRESS]
